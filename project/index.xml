      <description>Introduction library(flexmix) data(dmft) I chose to use the “dmft” dataset from the package “flexmix”. This dataset includes observations of a study on the efficacy of various methods to improve dental hygiene and reduce caries in schoolchildren from an urban area of Brazil. The main numeric variables, ‘End’ and ‘Begin’, describe the number of abnormal teeth (decayed, missing, or filled) for each child at the end and beginning of the study.</description>

      <description>Introduction After living at home for over a year, I was curious as to which degree the pandemic had changed in the US. I obtained datasets tracking COVID-19 statistics on a state level from the COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/data/download), deciding to use data from Texas &amp;amp; California because they are controlled by opposing political parties but are similar in being the most populous states of the US. This comparison is interesting to me because it can show the effects of policies and public sentiment, along with showing the development in COVID-19 prevention on a state level.</description>
